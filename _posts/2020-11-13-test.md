A few weeks ago, at the bakery where I work, a coworker and I were talking about how much our store operations under COVID-19 restrictions had changed compared to pre-COVID times. Since we stopped taking in-store orders to limit the amount of customers in the store and switched to a pick-up only system, the main difference was that most of our customer interactions were over the phone or online now, instead of face to face. I said that I preferred this new system, since even before the pandemic, working as customer service to the rude and impatient regulars wasn’t something particularly enjoyable, so replacing face to face interactions with the more distant, impersonal phone conversations didn’t seem so bad to me. My coworker agreed, but then backtracked, noting that in the tradeoff, customers over the phone seemed to be less obligated towards being patient or polite, as if by not physically seeing us, they wouldn’t have to deal with how we would react to their manners. Impatient sighs over the ordering process and bold, condescending remarks over our “hyper-paranoid” store policies were not held back over phone conversations. However, once the customers had to actually enter the store to pick up their order, their bravery often disappears, and they hastily run in and out while avoiding eye contact, even though we all know they were the ones yelling at us over the phone beforehand. 

I forgot about this conversation until reading “Anatomy of an AI System” by Kate Crawford. In her discussion of the Amazon Echo and “Alexa,” I connect the role of Alexa back to my own experiences in the bakery. Alexa and I are both appointed to listen, take orders, and provide service. However, there is a sense of obligation to be invisible and calm, despite whoever we are taking orders from, and how it seems that the more “invisible” we are, the more comfortable others are in pushing their own demands on us in ways that are dehumanizing and speak much to the ways in which people treat those who they view as servants to them.

Obviously, Alexa is not a human. Alexa is an AI, and AIs don’t have to deal with fatigue, or frustration like service workers might. Alexa can work 24 hours a day and won’t take it to heart if you raise your voice at her. However, I find it interesting that the creators of Alexa (and other AI assistants such as Siri) make efforts towards having her simulate humanity with tone inflections instead of a robotic monotone voice, use of common phrases such as “I’m sorry,” and “Hello,” and even giving her a gender and human name. Perhaps these simulations of humanity make us as users more comfortable, as if we are talking to a real human, and perhaps to be even more specific, a female receptionist-like human. It’s often noted that the role of Alexa is a replication of the often submissive, female secretary/receptionist figure seen throughout the past decades. Though users can change her name and her voice, the calming, attentive, feminine voice is always the default when installing a new Alexa. 

However, in the opposite sense, there are also efforts to make sure Alexa is not too human as well. The Amazon Echo is not shaped as a woman, nor is there any visualization of a mouth moving when she speaks, nor do we hear her breathe. The Echo is a small, simple, sleek cylinder which Crawford describes as “maintain[ing] a kind of blankness: nothing will alert the owner to the vast network that subtends and drives its interactive capacities” (part II, paragraph 1). In this way, Alexa is made to be invisible as well, by not taking up much space, speaking only when spoken to, and disguising the complexity of her inner workings with a smooth minimalistic outer shell. She is human enough for us users to feel comfortable talking to, however, invisible enough to not have to think too hard about what sacrifices or hardships had to be made in order for her development and existence, or how we interact with a human-like machine and how that interaction reflects upon us as humans. 

In thinking about just the exterior design of the Echo, I realize that many of our other technologies seem to be on an inevitable trajectory towards minimalist aesthetics as well, such as phones, tablets, and monitors, even though they’re much more capable of performing more tasks and holding more data than their bulky ancestors. By some miracle, my iPhone 5 (which I got in 2016) is still working, although it's bent at the edges and there is a thin crack running diagonally across my screen. What it also has though, that sleeker new models (are we at the iPhone 10 now? 11?) don’t is an actual button. One, to be exact, compared to the sliding phone I had in high school, which had a button for every number and letter of the alphabet and then some. In addition, my phone still has the headphone jack as well which is one of the main reasons why the iPhone 5 is thicker and bulkier than the newer models. All of this is to say recently, while the technologies of our tools advance and get more complicated, the design and outward appearance simplifies, increasing the distance between how we think of our technologies versus how complex they actually are. 

I want to clarify what I mean by recently, as in perhaps the last ten years or so, because I do remember that there was an era around the 90’s-early 2000’s where the desired aesthetic for new popular technologies such as McIntosh monitors and Playstation controllers were not concealing, minimalist exteriors. Instead, they were transparent shells, revealing all the gears and wires and electrical circuits inside and allowing for consumers to marvel at the complex inner workings of their latest high tech investment. Therefore, today’s sleek and mysterious minimalist aesthetic is not so much a natural progression in design as it is more of a conscious choice. The decision in the 90’s-2000’s to make visible was to awe and excite users about the futures of technologies, whereas the decision now may be actually to conceal the process and subvert our attention from what actually goes into making these new technologies.

The more simple they look, the more we view our gadgets as neutral, convenient pieces of our everyday lives, and the less we have to acknowledge that the materials of our phones and Amazon Echos are physically sourced from finite resources. Those who are sourcing them are severely overworked and underpaid, and those who live where the sources are have to watch their land become increasingly ravaged and depleted and their culture and voices be ignored and silenced. As Crawford quotes from Liam Young and Kate Davies about the harvesting of Lithium in southwest Bolivia and Aymara legend, “your smartphone runs on the tears and breast milk of a volcano. This landscape is connected to everywhere on the planet via the phones in our pockets.; linked to each of us by invisible threads of commerce, science, politics and power” (part III, paragraph 2).

With all of this, I’m left to wonder about what other active decisions that tech developers and multibillion dollar corporations are making to increase the distance between how we think of our technologies as convenient, necessary, and simply existing for our everyday use and how little we actually know about where they come from and who has suffered along the way for them to exist. Furthermore, how are these developers and corporations pushing for the labor behind these technologies to remain invisible, and laying out excuses and obstacles for their consumers to justify not seeing the consequences of them. And perhaps, they may not be making much effort at all, because the habit of turning a blind eye towards the suffering of others who live continents away and refusal to acknowledge that people who work in the service and labor industry are also humans is already so deeply and historically ingrained in our capitalist society.
